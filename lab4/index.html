		<h1>Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task - Making a Painting</h1>
	</div>
	<div>
		<pre>	- Develop idea for painting
		- Sit on a porch and ponder the meaning of life!
			- Look for inspiration from surroundings
				- Take note of people, objects, and ideas in your environment
		- Reflect on past experiences for alternative inspirations or ideas to supplement your work
				- Recall memories or past ideas that could pertain to you new art piece
				- Consider previous works of art or creative experiences
	- Sketch what the painting will look like
		- Do a series of sketches exploring various iterations and modes of expressing the idea.
				- These can be done using thumbnail sketches, which are small quick sketches to get the visual
					  aspect of an idea onto paper.
				- Look through the thumbnail sketches and determine which best represents the aforementioned
					idea.
	- Gather painting supplies
		- Painting supplies list:
				- Painting surface (canvas, paper, cardboard, metal sheet, grandmother's sweater?)
				- Desired painting medium (Oil, acrylic, spray, etc…)
				- Condition: If using oil paints, some painting mediums may be required such as: galkyd, linseed
					  oil, paint thinner, etc…
				- Paint brushes of varying sizes and types depending on the desired painting effects which are
					  to be used.
				- A palette and various containers for mixing paint and paint mediums.
				- Blue painters tape
				- Measuring tools
	- Set up painting:
		- Cut desired size of painting surface out (for this instance it will be a 9” x 12” piece of Oil
				  paper)
		- Cut two 14” lengths of and two 11” lengths of blue painters tape
		- Affix the tape to the border of the paper and then the taped paper to the wall.
		- On a table or desk of some sort, place your painting materials
				- Fill mason jar half full with paint thinner
				- Fill another with about an inch of linseed oil
				- Keep galkyd handy
				- On the palette, squeeze out a dollop of paint of each color
				 - 1 dollop of Alizarin Crimson (Red)
				 - 1 dollop of Phthalo Blue (Blue)
				 - 1 dollop of Cadmium Yellow (Yellow)
				 - 1 dollop of Burnt Umber (Dark Brown)
				 - 1 large dollop of Titanium White (White)
				 	- With these colors, nearly any color can be mixed using proper color theory
				- Rinse brushes in paint thinner to remove any excess paint from prior uses.
				- Prime the brushes for use with linseed oil for better paint application
		- Once all the painting supplies are ready to be used, plot out the painting lightly using a
				2H pencil.
				- This should be gestural, and define the areas, shapes and perhaps value ranges which are to
					be used in the painting
				- No details at this stage
		- To begin painting, apply a base layer of 1 part burnt umber 2 parts paint thinner and a bit of
				galkyd
				- This will create a translucent brown which is fast drying and will easily cover the painting
					surface
				- While it is still wet, wipe away the shapes and areas which will have a lighter value in the
					final painting
				- This will create a sketch-like image which represents the range of values and their respective
					orientation on the painting surface
		- Once this layer is dry, block in larger areas of color. This is called the underpainting.
		- Assess the painting as it unfolds and determine any changes that must be made.
			- Once the underpainting is dry, begin to work with smaller brushes and render more details
				- In order to produce a luminant painting, it is best to begin with medium values
						and work outward to the more extreme values of dark and light
		- Once the painting is fully rendered, paint the lightest lights, and darkest darks in order to
				make the image really… POP!
	- Once the painting is complete, rinse brushes in Paint thinner, re-prime them with linseed oil so
			that they maintain their quality
		- Clean painting area
			- Wipe down any surfaces which got paint or medium on them.
			- Seal up paints and mediums
	- Now remove the tape from the painting to reveal the finished painting.
	- Sign the painting on the white border which was revealed when the tape was removed.
	- Congratulations! You’ve made a beautiful painting!

		<h1>Task 2: Pseudocode a computer task - Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>
	</div>
	<div>
	 <pre>
		- Give users the following options: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
		- Accept random selection input from user
		- Generate a random selection of Rock, Paper, or Scissors by computer
		- Evaluate outcome of user / computer selections using Rock Paper Scissors Rules:
			- Rock, Rock = Draw. Redo game
			- Rock, Paper = Paper wins
			- Rock, Scissors = Rock wins
			- Paper, Paper = Draw. Redo game
			- Paper, Rock = Paper wins
			- Paper, Scissors = Scissors wins
			- Scissors, Scissors = Draw. Redo game
			- Scissors, Rock = Rock Wins
			- Scissors, Paper = Scissors wins.
		- Record “wins” generated by user input
			- Stop at 2 wins
		- Record “wins” generated by computer input
			- Stop at 2 wins
		- Recognize “stop”
			- winner is determined by user/computer that caused “stop”
		- Display message signifying winner

		<h1>Challenges</h1>
				<p>
					The challenge of this lab was to deconstruct both a task in everyday
					life and a task within a technological format into an organized list of
					steps. We needed to create a chronological list of functions, expanded
					upon with the specifics of each step, a person must fulfill in order to
					complete each task. For our "everyday task", we choose to explain
					the process of conceptualizing, drafting, creating a painting.
					For the "computer task", we illustrated the functions and conduct of a
					Rock, Paper, Scissors game.<br>
				</p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p>
				For the “everyday task” of creating a painting, we found it difficult
				to create a concrete list of steps for something that relies heavily on
				personal creativity. When describing the steps to “Develop Idea for
				Painting”, there is no specific way to instruct someone in the process of
				translating abstract ideas, personal experiences, or observations of the
				world into a perceivable piece of art. So rather than a strict set of
				instructions, the proceeding subsection was more of a general list of
				suggestions to help incite inspiration to build off of. We also found it
				difficult to decide what instructions should be highlighted as “high-level
				tasks” and what should be formatted as “sub-tasks”. For instance, “Sketch
				what the painting will look like” would be considered “high-level” because it
				presents an overarching summary of what one will need to do in that part
				of the painting process. But the specifics of completing “a series of sketches…”
				and deciding between “thumbnail sketches” are all descriptors or clarifications
				of the main step, so these are formatted as “subtasks”.<br>
				<br>
				For the computer task, it was challenging to construct a game that initially
				relies on spontaneous selections. Since Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game of
				random chance, we needed to ensure that there was no opportunity of strategy
				on either end of the screen. So while the user makes a selection of “Rock”,
				“Paper”, or “Scissors”, the computer generates a random selection of the
				three with no knowledge of the user's choice. These two selections could then
				be evaluated with a list of possible outcomes to determine the winner. Another
				issue was creating a definitive end to the rounds of Row Sham Bow to declare
				an overall winner between the user and the computer. To do this, we instructed
				the game to “record wins” from individual games. Once either the computer
				or user reached “2 wins”, this could be considered winning “best two out of
				three”.
			</p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
			<p>
				Our first pseudocode task gives a step-by-step guide in creating a painting.
				It begins with the metaphysical process of coming up with a concept to express
				visually. Despite the infinite ways an individual can conjure and use inspirations,
				 we give several suggestions to help catalyse the process. This includes
				 observing your surroundings, reflection of past experience, or simply taking
				 time to “ponder life”. Then, we instruct the artist to translate their concept
				 into a sketch. Creating a collection of thumbnail sketches, they can then pick
				 which most accurate represents their original concept to paint. After developing
				 a draft to reference, we then instruct the artist to gather a list of tools
				 encompassing all of the basic painting supplies (canvas, paint, brushes, palette,
				 painters tape, etc.). The artist is next asked to set up their tools and mediums
				 to begin creating. This involves cutting out and mounting desired surface
				 material, sorting and applying paint to a palette, and finally prepping the
				 brushes with paint thinner and oil. Since the process of actually making art
				 can be just as open-ended as conceptualizing it, we then give the artist a
				 basic tutorial on “Underpainting”, a specific technique of layering and
				 wiping away paint that the artist can choose to incorporate into their creation
				 process. We give additional tips such as suggesting smaller brushes for finer detail
				 and methods of color placement to attain a “luminant” effect. After a masterpiece
				 is produced, we wrap up our instructions with the steps to finalize the art
				 and clean up the working station. <br>
				<br>
				Our pseudocode task pertaining to a computer creates a playable game of Rock,
				Paper, Scissors between the user and the computer. The game would begin
				giving the user a selection of “Rock”, “Paper”, “Scissors”. The user would
				be asked to input a random selection of the three options with no knowledge
				of the computer’s input. Once the user input one of the options, both their
				option and a randomly generated input from the computer would be presented
				on the screen. The two options would then be evaluated using a list of possible
				outcomes to determine a winner of that round. These outcomes describe the input
				of one party, the input of the other party, and which was superior (e.g.
				“Rock, Paper = Paper wins”). In the case that bother parties gave the same
				input, the outcome is described as a draw (e.g. “Scissors, Scissors = Draw.
				Redo game”). This would not count as a win for either party. The user would
				be prompted to play the game again until either they or the computer had
				reached a record of two wins. At this point, the party with two wins would
				be identified as the “overall winner”.
