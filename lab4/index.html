		<h1>Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task - Making a Painting</h1>

		<ul>
			<li id:"a">Develop Idea for Painting<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Sit on a porch and ponder the meaning of life...<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Look for inspiration from surroundings<br></li>
			<li id:"c">Take note of people, objects, and ideas in your environment<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Reflect on past experiences for alternative inspirations or ideas to supplement your work<br></li>
			<li id:"c">Recall memories or past ideas that could pertain to you new art piece<br></li>
			<li id:"c">Consider previous works of art or creative experiences<br></li>
			<li id:"a">Sketch what the painting will look like.<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Do a series of sketches exploring various iterations and modes of expressing the idea.<br></li>
			<li id:"c">These can be done using thumbnail sketches, which are small quick sketches to get the visual aspect of an idea onto paper.<br></li>
			<li id:"c">Look through the thumbnail sketches and determine which best represents the aforementioned idea.<br></li>
			<li id:"a">Gather painting supplies<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Painting supplies list:<br></li>
			<li id:"c">Painting surface (canvas, paper, cardboard, metal sheet, grandmother's sweater?)<br></li>
			<li id:"c">Desired painting medium (Oil, acrylic, spray, etc…)<br></li>
			<li id:"d">Condition: If using oil paints, some painting mediums may be required such as: galkyd, linseed oil, paint thinner, etc…<br></li>
			<li id:"c">Paint brushes of varying sizes and types depending on the desired painting effects which are to be used.<br></li>
			<li id:"c">A palette and various containers for mixing paint and paint mediums.<br></li>
			<li id:"c">Blue painters tape<br></li>
			<li id:"c">Measuring tools<br></li>
			<li id:"a">Set up painting:<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Cut desired size of painting surface out (for this instance it will be a 9” x 12” piece of Oil paper)<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Cut two 14” lengths o and two 11” lengths of blue painters tape<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Affix the tape to the border of the paper and then the taped paper to the wall.<br></li>
			<li id:"b">On a table or desk of some sort, place your painting materials<br></li>
			<li id:"c">Fill mason jar half full with paint thinner<br></li>
			<li id:"c">Fill another with about an inch of linseed oil<br></li>
			<li id:"c">Keep galkyd handy<br></li>
			<li id:"c">On the palette, squeeze out a dollop of paint of each color<br></li>
			<li id:"d">1 dollop of Alizarin Crimson (Red)<br></li>
			<li id:"d">1 dollop of Phthalo Blue (Blue)<br></li>
			<li id:"d">1 dollop of Cadmium Yellow (Yellow)<br></li>
			<li id:"d">1 dollop of Burnt Umber (Dark Brown)<br></li>
			<li id:"d">1 large dollop of Titanium White (White)<br></li>
			<li id:"d">With these colors, nearly any color can be mixed using proper color theory<br></li>
			<li id:"c">Rinse brushes in paint thinner to remove any excess paint from prior uses.<br> </li>
			<li id:"c">Prime the brushes for use with linseed oil for better paint application<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Once all the painting supplies are ready to be used, plot out the painting lightly using a 2H pencil.<br></li>
			<li id:"c">This should be gestural, and define the areas, shapes and perhaps value ranges which are to be used in the painting<br></li>
			<li id:"c">No details at this stage<br></li>
			<li id:"b">To begin painting, apply a base layer of 1 part burnt umber 2 parts paint thinner and a bit of galkyd<br></li>
			<li id:"c">This will create a translucent brown which is fast drying and will easily cover the painting surface<br></li>
			<li id:"c">While it is still wet, wipe away the shapes and areas which will have a lighter value in the final painting<br></li>
			<li id:"c">This will create a sketch-like image which represents the range of values and their respective orientation on the painting surface<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Once this layer is dry, block in larger areas of color. This is called the underpainting.<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Assess the painting as it unfolds and determine any changes that must be made.<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Once the underpainting is dry, begin to work with smaller brushes and render more details<br></li>
			<li id:"b">In order to produce a luminant painting, it is best to begin with medium values and work outward to the more extreme values of dark and light<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Once the painting is fully rendered, paint the lightest lights, and darkest darks in order to make the image really… POP!<br></li>
			<li id:"a">Once the painting is complete, rinse brushes in Paint thinner, re-prime them with linseed oil so that they maintain their quality<br></li>
			<li id:"a">Clean painting area<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Wipe down any surfaces which got paint or medium on them.<br></li>
			<li id:"b">Seal up paints and mediums<br></li>
			<li id:"a">Now remove the tape from the painting to reveal the finished painting.<br></li>
			<li id:"a">Sign the painting on the white border which was revealed when the tape was removed.<br></li>
			<li id:"a">Congratulations! You’ve made a beautiful painting!<br></li>
