		<h1>Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task - Making a Painting</h1>
	</div>
	<div>
		<pre>
			- Develop idea for painting
				- Sit on a porch and ponder the meaning of life!
					- Look for inspiration from surroundings
				 	- Take note of people, objects, and ideas in your environment
				- Reflect on past experiences for alternative inspirations or ideas to supplement your work
				 	- Recall memories or past ideas that could pertain to you new art piece
				 	- Consider previous works of art or creative experiences
			- Sketch what the painting will look like
				- Do a series of sketches exploring various iterations and modes of expressing the idea.
				 	- These can be done using thumbnail sketches, which are small quick sketches to get the visual
					  aspect of an idea onto paper.
				 	- Look through the thumbnail sketches and determine which best represents the aforementioned
					  idea.
			- Gather painting supplies
				- Painting supplies list:
				 	- Painting surface (canvas, paper, cardboard, metal sheet, grandmother's sweater?)
				 	- Desired painting medium (Oil, acrylic, spray, etc…)
				 	- Condition: If using oil paints, some painting mediums may be required such as: galkyd, linseed
					  oil, paint thinner, etc…
				 	- Paint brushes of varying sizes and types depending on the desired painting effects which are
					  to be used.
				 	- A palette and various containers for mixing paint and paint mediums.
				 	- Blue painters tape
				 	- Measuring tools
			- Set up painting:
				- Cut desired size of painting surface out (for this instance it will be a 9” x 12” piece of Oil
				  paper)
				- Cut two 14” lengths of and two 11” lengths of blue painters tape
				- Affix the tape to the border of the paper and then the taped paper to the wall.
				- On a table or desk of some sort, place your painting materials
				 	- Fill mason jar half full with paint thinner
				 	- Fill another with about an inch of linseed oil
				 	- Keep galkyd handy
				 	- On the palette, squeeze out a dollop of paint of each color
				 		- 1 dollop of Alizarin Crimson (Red)
				 		- 1 dollop of Phthalo Blue (Blue)
				 		- 1 dollop of Cadmium Yellow (Yellow)
				 		- 1 dollop of Burnt Umber (Dark Brown)
				 		- 1 large dollop of Titanium White (White)
				 			- With these colors, nearly any color can be mixed using proper color theory
				 	- Rinse brushes in paint thinner to remove any excess paint from prior uses.
				 	- Prime the brushes for use with linseed oil for better paint application
				- Once all the painting supplies are ready to be used, plot out the painting lightly using a
				  2H pencil.
				 	- This should be gestural, and define the areas, shapes and perhaps value ranges which are to
					  be used in the painting
				 	- No details at this stage
				- To begin painting, apply a base layer of 1 part burnt umber 2 parts paint thinner and a bit of
				  galkyd
				 	- This will create a translucent brown which is fast drying and will easily cover the painting
					  surface
				 	- While it is still wet, wipe away the shapes and areas which will have a lighter value in the
					  final painting
				 	- This will create a sketch-like image which represents the range of values and their respective
					  orientation on the painting surface
				- Once this layer is dry, block in larger areas of color. This is called the underpainting.
				- Assess the painting as it unfolds and determine any changes that must be made.
					- Once the underpainting is dry, begin to work with smaller brushes and render more details
						- In order to produce a luminant painting, it is best to begin with medium values
						  and work outward to the more extreme values of dark and light
				- Once the painting is fully rendered, paint the lightest lights, and darkest darks in order to
				  make the image really… POP!
			- Once the painting is complete, rinse brushes in Paint thinner, re-prime them with linseed oil so
			  that they maintain their quality
				- Clean painting area
				 - Wipe down any surfaces which got paint or medium on them.
				 - Seal up paints and mediums
			- Now remove the tape from the painting to reveal the finished painting.
			- Sign the painting on the white border which was revealed when the tape was removed.
			- Congratulations! You’ve made a beautiful painting!

		<h1>Task 2: Pseudocode a computer task - Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>
	</div>
	<div>
		<pre>
			- Give users the following options: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
			- Accept random selection input from user
			- Generate a random selection of Rock, Paper, or Scissors by computer
			- Evaluate outcome of user / computer selections using Rock Paper Scissors Rules:
				- Rock, Rock = Draw. Redo game
				- Rock, Paper = Paper wins
				- Rock, Scissors = Rock wins
				- Paper, Paper = Draw. Redo game
				- Paper, Rock = Paper wins
				- Paper, Scissors = Scissors wins
				- Scissors, Scissors = Draw. Redo game
				- Scissors, Rock = Rock Wins
				- Scissors, Paper = Scissors wins.
			- Record “wins” generated by user input
				- Stop at 2 wins
			- Record “wins” generated by computer input
				- Stop at 2 wins
			- Recognize “stop”
				- winner is determined by user/computer that caused “stop”
			- Display message signifying winner

		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<img src="img/thing1.jpg">
			<p>
				The challenge of this lab was to deconstruct both a task in everyday
				life and a task within a technological format into an organized list of
				steps. We needed to create a chronological list of functions, expanded
				upon with the specifics of each step, a person must fulfill in order to
				complete each task. For our "everyday task", we choose to explain
				the process of conceptualizing, drafting, creating a painting.
				For the "computer task", we illustrated the functions and conduct of a
				Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
			</p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p>
				For the “everyday task” of creating a painting, we found it difficult
				to create a concrete list of steps for something that relies heavily on
				personal creativity. When describing the steps to “Develop Idea for
				Painting”, there is no specific way to instruct someone in the process of
				translating abstract ideas, personal experiences, or observations of the
				world into a perceivable piece of art. So rather than a strict set of
				instructions, the proceeding subsection was more of a general list of
				suggestions to help incite inspiration to build off of. We also found it
				difficult to decide what instructions should be highlighted as “high-level
				tasks” and what should be formatted as “sub-tasks”. For instance, “Sketch
				what the painting will look like” would be considered “high-level” because it
				presents an overarching summary of what one will need to do in that part
				of the painting process. But the specifics of completing “a series of sketches…”
				and deciding between “thumbnail sketches” are all descriptors or clarifications
				of the main step, so these are formatted as “subtasks”.<br>
				<br>
				For the computer task, it was challenging to construct a game that initially
				relies on spontaneous selections. Since Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game of
				random chance, we needed to ensure that there was no opportunity of strategy
				on either end of the screen. So while the user makes a selection of “Rock”,
				“Paper”, or “Scissors”, the computer generates a random selection of the
				three with no knowledge of the user's choice. These two selections could then
				be evaluated with a list of possible outcomes to determine the winner. Another
				issue was creating a definitive end to the rounds of Row Sham Bow to declare
				an overall winner between the user and the computer. To do this, we instructed
				the game to “record wins” from individual games. Once either the computer
				or user reached “2 wins”, this could be considered winning “best two out of
				three”.
