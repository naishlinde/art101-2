	<h2>Challenges<h2>
		<p>
			The challenge was to first practice creating lists and objects with various
		 	elements that can be accurately referenced by a user input. We first needed
		 	to practice in our browser console creating an array that lists the types of
		 	transportation we can use. Then we needed to supplement that list by declaring
		 	a vehicle as an object with attributes such as make, model, color, etc.
		 	After practicing printing the two using the “consol.log” input, we needed
		 	to move over to a javascript file and declare all of the same variables.
		 	Have it print into lines of text in our webpage using “document.writeln”
		 	and the “JSON.stringify()”. Finally we needed to create an html.index to link
		 	to that js file and customize it through css.
		</p>
	<h2>Issues<h2>
			<p>Within task one there was no issue, just a long series of happy accidents.
			 Our first challenge was using printing both of our variables in the console
			 of our browser while  we initially practiced in step one. There was no issue
			 defining the array and object. When writing, “console.log(...)”, we couldn’t
			 nail the correct format to include both variables in the output. In JavaScript,
			 we managed to rewrite all of our variables, but instead of using “document.writeln”
			 we were using “document.write” to output our variables. After a series of
			 intellectual acrobatics, we found the correct formatting use “document.writeln”
			 by referencing the example photo in the Lab #6 assignments.
		 	</p>
	<h2>Results<h2>
		<p>The contents of this site are the results of our work. We encountered a
			multitude of obstacles when trying to tackle this lab. It was a rollercoaster
			ride of emotion. We got everything to work satisfactorily on the console.
			Migrating over to the JS file was challenging, but we were able to problem
			solve and got everything to function properly.
