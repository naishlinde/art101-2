        <p>"From the first imitative babble of a child to the despotism
            of eloquence, from his first pile of toys or chip bridge to
            the masonry of Minot Rock Lighthouse or the Pacific Railroad,
            from the tattooing of the Owhyhees to the Vatican Gallery,
            from the simplest expedient of private prudence to the American
            Constitution, from its first to its last works, Art is the spirit's
            voluntary use and combination of things to serve its end."<br>
            - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
        <p>"If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom
          of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting
          in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; If an
          unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what
          would life be but despair?"<br>
          - SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard</p>
        <p>"A single gentle rain makes the grass many shades greener. So our
          prospects brighten on the influx of better thoughts. We should be
          blessed if we lived in the present always, and took advantage of
          every accident that befell us, like the grass which confesses the
          influence of the slightest dew that falls on it."<br>
          - Henry David Thoreau</p>
        <p>"Close your dream and push it away
          a sterile miracle of your inner fine ghost
          is a morgue with an imprint of sea and continents
          a mighty history patching up its root system
          to emerge in the pause of identification as work"<br>
