        <p>"From the first imitative babble of a child to the despotism
            of eloquence, from his first pile of toys or chip bridge to
            the masonry of Minot Rock Lighthouse or the Pacific Railroad,
            from the tattooing of the Owhyhees to the Vatican Gallery,
            from the simplest expedient of private prudence to the American
            Constitution, from its first to its last works, Art is the spirit's
            voluntary use and combination of things to serve its end."<br>
            - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
        <p>"If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom
          of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting
          in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; If an
          unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what
          would life be but despair?"<br>
          - SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard</p>
        <p>"A single gentle rain makes the grass many shades greener. So our
          prospects brighten on the influx of better thoughts. We should be
          blessed if we lived in the present always, and took advantage of
          every accident that befell us, like the grass which confesses the
          influence of the slightest dew that falls on it."<br>
          - Henry David Thoreau</p>
        <p>"Close your dream and push it away<br>
          a sterile miracle of your inner fine ghost<br>
          is a morgue with an imprint of sea and continents<br>
          a mighty history patching up its root system<br>
          to emerge in the pause of identification as work"<br>
          - Karen Weiser</p>
        <p>"We are delicate machines, and require nice treatment to get from us
           the maximum of power and pleasure. We need tonics, but must have those
           that cost little or no reaction. The flame of life burns too fast in
           pure oxygen, and nature has tempered the air with nitrogen. So thought
           is the native air of the mind, yet pure it is a poison to our mixed
           constitution, and soon burns up the bone-house of man, unless tempered
           with affection and course practice in the material world."<br>
           - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
