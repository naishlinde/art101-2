      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Our challenge was to experiment with the setTimeout function and anonymous functions to ultimately use several callbacks at different times. Our first task was to create an HTML file containing our challenges, issues, and results. The key point to this task was linking our JavaScript File in the head of our document as opposed to the body. The next portion of the lab was to create a JavaScript file to run several tests on. This first test required a straightforward print of some text. The second test required that we run our original functions through the setTimeout function by making them anonymous functions. We set the specific times to 0 milliseconds, so they would be printed in their original order. For the third test, set the time for firstThing to be 3000 milliseconds, secondThing to be 1000 milliseconds, and thirdThing to be 2000 milliseconds. This way the resulting order of our test would be 2, 3, 1. Finally, we needed to test and upload our web pages, checking our results on the console. Additionally, our bonus tasks asked us the reason for using console.log rather than document.writeln, the legitimacy of using document.getElementById("output") to print console outputs on our webpage, methods of callbacks ect...

      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>There weren’t many issues with the lab itself, but the Bonus Task was very challenging. For the second question of the task, we were asked to print out the results of the setTImeout function on our actual webpage in addition to the console log. We were not sure whether to write the additional code in the JavaScript file or the HTML file. We needed to consult the lecture notes to clarify that "js-output” was meant to be in the HTML file. Regardless, we were still stumped in getting the second part of Task X to work.

      <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Open the console to check out our JS anon functions and callbacks in action! This lab provided little content
           which appears on the page, so we added some extra content to fill out the page, boost the its aesthetics, and add some humor. We used a CSS background template (licensed to public use) to implement
           animated particles to our website (properly citing our source by commenting it into the file structure
           as well as including a license in the file structure). We thought it would be a cool addition to our
           site and an opportunity to learn about various CSS capabilities. </p>
