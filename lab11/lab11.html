         <h1>Challenges</h1>
           <p>Our challenge was to create a website that uses jQuery to manipulate and add new elements. First, we needed to be created an html file with the usual challenges, problems, and results. Only this time, we needed to assign each of those to a div so we could add a button and various functions to them throughjQuery in Java Script. In JavaScript, we needed to find find the elements we wanted to add buttons to using the $ symbol and CSS notation (#), then create buttons with names for each of those elements, finally we had to add those buttons to each element by using .append(myButton). Finally, we needed to add the event listener, “click”, and have the function toggle specific CSS changes with the class “special”.

       </div>
       <div id = "problems">
         <h1>Problems</h1>
           <p>We briefly had an issue getting sections of the CSS to be activated by the button and automatically change when it’s clicked. We fixed this issue by putting the ‘.’ before the class name in the css. Otherwise, this lab went smoothly. jQuery is a very useful and comprehensible tool for writing JS. It makes what was learned in the past few labs more accessible.
