		<p id= "self_paragraph">Hi guys! I'm Jason. I'm a third year Art & Design: Games and Playable Media major with a CS minor.<br>
			I'm pretty fluent in most popular languages (save for Python) like C++, C, Java, JavaScript, Lua<br>
			etc etc. I spend a lot of my time working on my Roblox games that I've built since high school. I'm<br>
			a huge fan of American football and the Seattle Seahawks (so if you want to talk to someone about<br>
			football look no further). I don't have that much experience with web development which is why I<br>
			was interested in this class, but I'm super excited to work with you guys!<br>

		 <p id= "self_paragraph">Hey my name is Ignatius but I go by Naish, I’m from Washington, DC, my pronouns are he/him/they/them,<br>
			  and I'm a second year art major. I'm an abstract painter, digital artist, and poet. I have never coded<br>
				before but I'm really excited to delve into it! I love everything creative music, writing, art, etc…<br>
				My spirit animal is either an owl or a cougar.<br>
