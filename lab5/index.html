	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>My main struggle with this assignment resulted while attempting to style the text being printed by the javascript. I realized, after many futile attempts and unfruitful w3schools searches, that I am not yet capable of accomplishing this task. Otherwise, I was able to complete this lab with relative ease.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The contents of this page are the results of this lab. I feel comfortable with the content of this lab. I'm eager to see what more can be done with this powerful creative tool.</p>
	<h2>Bug in the Rain: A Poem</h2>
		<p>
			He was inside her,<br>
			She was wet and moaning.<br>
			His name was Jimmy,<br>
			Her name was Julie.<br>
			Jimmy rode Julie all day<br>
			and all night.<br>
			He loved her, and spoke<br>
			softly to her when<br>
			he was inside her.<br>
			Jimmy loved his 1965<br>
			Chartreuse Volkswagen Beetle,<br>
			which upon purchasing,<br>
			he named Julie.<br>
