		<p>"I saw a distant river by moonlight, making no noise, yet flowing, as by day, still to the sea, like melted silver reflecting the moonlight. Far away it lay encircling the earth. How far away it may look in the night, and even from a low hill how miles away down the valley. As far off as paradise and the delectable country. There is a certain glory attends on water by night. By it the heavens are related to the earth, undistinguishable from a sky beneath you." - Henry David Thoreau</p>
