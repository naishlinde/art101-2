      <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
      <h2>Naish Linde & Jordan Moore</h2>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>Our challenge was to create a function that would first ask the user for their name. It would then take the letters of their name and break each character into an item of an array. Next, it would sort the array alphabetically. Finally, it would reproduce the newly generated name for the user. We needed to link that Javascript function to a html page. And then customize it using CSS.</p>
      <h2>Issues</h2>
      <p>This lab was pretty straight forward. Our issues lay in the details. First we omitted the nameArraySort variable, and then upon realizing we had omitted the nameArraySort variable, we added it in but without the parentheses. The html file had an issue when adding the div containing the script link. It would turn all the text white and then turn it back to its colored formatting when reentered.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>And that’s the way the cookie crumbles. In the words of Porky Pig at the closing screen of many of the Looney Tunes short “Th-th-that’s all folks!” This Lab wasn’t too challenging. It just took attention to detail.
