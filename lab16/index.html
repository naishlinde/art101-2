      <h1>Lab 16: JSON & APIs</h1>
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Our challenge was to utilize an API and JSON to efficiently transfer information across the web into our website. Using JSON will allow us to more easily create interactively, communicative websites that are comprehensible for both the user and the creator. First, we needed to create an HTML file with our Challenges, Problems, and Results. It additionally needed to be linked to jQuery and JavaScript. Next, we needed to look into the API doc for XKDC, a weekly webcomic about computer science, to get the basics of how to apply the API to our page. Then, we needed to test the API endpoint in our browser, observing what kind of data it will return using a JSON Formatter extension. Finally, we needed to create a JavaScript File implementing our API data using $ajax to refer to the object, comicObj. We would then accessorize this object using .title, .img, and .alt.</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>During this lab we ran into a few problems. We had some difficulties with the API that was provided so we found a different api which we were able to get working.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>Here are the results of our Lab. You can use this website to retrieve a nerdy comic from XKDC. </p>
