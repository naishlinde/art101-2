           Our challenge was to use the Document Object Model (DOM) to add and
            alter elements of the HTML file in our JavaScript file. We first
             needed to create an average HTML file containing our usual Challenges,
              Problems, and Results sections with a link to the jS file in the head.
               We also needed to create a new, empty div with the id “output” so we
                could eventually append the children to it within the JS file. In JavaScript,
                 after we located our “output” element, we needed to add two new elements using
                  .innerHTML to input our own text and .style.fontFamily to change the font of
                   both new elements.
         </p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p id = "p2">
            We didn’t run into any issues pertaining to this lab. The only issue
             we ran into was linking the css, which is odd because we haven’t
              encountered this before. It was quickly fixed by re-adding a
               link to the css, using one from a previous lab. Otherwise,
                it was straightforward and highly informative. We feel much
                 more competent in JS and see more opportunities to get
                  creative with it than we had before.
