    <h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>Our was to use JavaScript and use loops to perform the same set of functions a certain number of times. We first needed to create an HTML file with our Challenges, Problems, and Results, linked to both our JavaScript file and jQuery. We additionally needed to include an empty output div to append our work in JavaScript to. Next, in the JavaScript file, we needed to loop through a series of numbers (or in our case, a series of animated tiles) to create a recurring pattern of “Fizz”, “Buzz”, and “Boom” (or in our case, a recurring pattern of different colors). We had to use modulus operators to distinguish certain tiles with assigned actions. Finally, we needed to use CSS to organize our list of numbers (or in our case, our block of animated pixels.)</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>For this lab, there weren’t any issues pertaining to the assigned tasks. We followed along during lecture so we were able to complete that portion without any problems. After finishing that, we decided to take it a few steps further. We had the idea to have each number generate a colored square which varied in color based upon parameters similar to those outlined by the lab. We first attempted to have the program print these squares initially and then have the loop alter the squares but this didn’t work, so we tried assigning each parameter a function which appended a square with a specified class which corresponds to the parameter. This worked. We thought it was a bit boring so we researched css animations on w3 schools and implemented them into the classes, so that instead of a single color the squares fade between 4 colors on varying intervals. It was difficult to get this to work but after tweaking the syntax a bit we got it going. </p>
