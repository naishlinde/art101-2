        <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>Our challenge was to create a website that would take the input of a user’s name and uses a modulus operator to divide the number of characters is that input by four. The remainder produced would then be used to assign the user one of four options. We first needed to create an html file with the usual Challenges, Problems, and Results. Then, we needed to include an input form field, a button, and an empty div titled “output”. In the JavaScript File, we needed to create a function that would count the letters in the string produced from the input form field, divide that number by 4 using the modulus operator, and then produce a remainder between 0-3. This number would then trigger one of four conditionals that to print a category under the button and input form field. The initial function needs to be triggered by an event listener attached to the button. </p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>We didn’t have any issues with this lab outside of normal troubleshooting. We did accidentally delete our HTML and CSS file toward the end of working on our website, so that sent us into a mild fit of panic. Luckily, we had our site open locally and could copy over our work from the console log. </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>You are looking at the results of our work. Instead of a sorting hat, we decided to make our website give the user one of the four main characters from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The user inputs their name and then clicks “Ask Splinter” to be dubbed a turtle.</p>
        <h2>Which Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Are You?!</h2>
        <p> Write your name to be given a hero with a half shell (TURLTLE POWER).</p>
